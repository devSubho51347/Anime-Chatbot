Users control the chains as they extend outwards from their body, most commonly to wrap around targets and restrain them.[2] The chains are extremely durable, enough that even the Nine-Tails would struggle to destroy them.[1] In the anime, in addition to physically binding targets, the chains are said to neutralise their target by binding and nullifying their chakra.[3] Depending on the number and the length of chains that users intend to produce, they may prefer to initially create only a few chains, which they send underground to split apart and spread around the area as needed, leaving their immediate surroundings uncluttered.[4]\n\nThe chains creating a barrier.The chains binding the Nine-Tails within Kushina's subconscious.1/2\nA barrier can be erected between two or more sealing chains, which is quite impregnable: Kushina Uzumaki creates such a barrier to not only prevent the Nine-Tails from escaping a defined area, but also to prevent the Third Hokage from entering it.[5] Because the chains are made of the user's chakra, the chains can be produced anywhere the user's chakra resides. When she was the Nine-Tails' jinch\u016briki, Kushina used the chains to bind the Nine-Tails within her subconscious,[6] and for this reason she never once lost control of its power.[1] After her death, some of Kushina's chakra was sealed within her son, Naruto Uzumaki, allowing her to produce the chains from his body in order to help him combat the Nine-Tails.[2]\nDuring the Fourth Shinobi World War, Karin awakens the ability to produce similar chains, which she uses to lash against and ultimately destroy a wooden opponent.

The spring water produced by The Hole appears to catalyse and speed up the recreation process because of the large \"life force\" flowing through it.[1] The downside to the accelerated rate at which the clone matures is that the snakes composing it have a very short lifespan, resulting in the clone splitting apart and dying after approximately 48 hours.[2]\nOnce the clone is created, Kabuto is able to gain control of it by placing a special talisman into its head. Depending on the talisman used, the clone can either become a mindless tool under Kabuto's control, with eyes possessing black sclera and white irides, or allowed to access their genetic source's personality and memories, while possessing eyes with dark grey sclera and white, snake-like irides. Clones produced through this method are also able to use any abilities possessed by their original selves, including those that they did not naturally acquire.[3] While not in battle, Kabuto stored the clones he created within large snakes, which would burst out of the ground and release their contents when needed.\nKabuto first used this technique to create a clone of Akatsuki member Hidan by placing snakes containing his DNA into the water produced by The Hole, causing them to quickly form into a humanoid shape, and then giving it life with a talisman. Later, snakes which had been ingested by Naruto Uzumaki created a clone of him upon exiting his body; a process which had greatly weakened him over the course of a day and ultimately paralysed him. Unlike the clone of Hidan, this clone did not require the insertion of a talisman to gain life and, due to the influence of Kurama's chakra, was formed in Naruto's four-tailed Version 2 state and possessed a strangely coloured body as well as a tail. The clone was also capable of resisting the control of Kabuto's talisman once it was inserted.[3]"}

Should the need arise, the toad can be used to transport whatever it has captured, releasing its contents when given the command.\nThe environment inside the toad's stomach is a cavernous chamber, which includes a lake of strong corrosive gastric acid that can dissolve anything that should happen to fall into it, along with shores around the acid lake, and rock formations sticking out of the lake; the already-existing structures within the Toad's stomach are seemingly unaffected by the acid lake. Once trapped inside, an opponent is cut off from any allies and susceptible to attack, and can then be easily defeated.\n\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 Sha no Sho, page 253"}

When the area is entered by an opponent, a barrier is created. The barrier's properties vary depending on the tags used:[1] the Sound Four, for example, use explosive tags, which allows it to serve as a sort of booby-trap.[2] To prevent the trap from being noticed, the individual tags are placed in hidden locations, such as the shade of trees. Even if the tags are discovered, actually disarming them is very difficult, for which reason it's generally safer to simply avoid the area.[1] Shikaku Nara once forced his son, Shikamaru, to read a book that discussed this technique, which described it as \"a high-class ninjutsu\".[2]"}

For information on the character, see Asura Path. For other uses, see Asura (disambiguation).\n\n\n\n\nThe Asura Path (\u4fee\u7f85\u9053, Shurad\u014d) grants the user the ability to augment their own body to summon mechanised armour and various ballistic and mechanical weaponry.[2]  During his lifetime, Nagato channelled the Asura Path through the body of a ninja puppeteer.\n\nContents\n\n1 Usage\n2 Mechanisms\n3 Influences\n4 References\n\n\nUsage[]\nThrough the Asura Path, the user is able to form up to four additional arms and two additional faces, as well as a folded, serrated blade-like sash around their waist. These additional appendages, as well as the user's body as a whole, are augmented with a variety of mechanical weaponry, which they can access at will. The user can fire their forearms as long-range projectiles or pull them off to reveal and fire a cluster of segmented missiles at targets. They are also able to protrude a set of flexible blades and drills or a series of mechanical tendrils from their arms, as well as quickly propel themselves forward by emitting a burst of chakra from holes in their feet. The user can also release a powerful chakra blast, which is capable of destroying numerous buildings at once, either by transforming one of their hands into a cannon or by opening the crown of their head.\nThe body through which Nagato channelled the Asura Path displayed enough raw physical power to rip Jiraiya's arm off and crush his throat with basic taijutsu, as well as to throw the Animal Path all the way into Konohagakure from the outskirts of the village. Additionally, the Asura Path was able to survive otherwise fatal damage due to its mechanised insides. All of these abilities befitted the \"warring demon\" name that the Asura Path held, whilst giving it a considerable degree of versatility.\n\n\nMechanisms[]\nThe detached hand being launched.As displayed through Nagato's Path, not only was the arm detachable, but a cluster of segmented missiles produced from within it.The arm itself could be used as a launching pad to launch the missiles.The Path's head opening up to reveal a cannon.The Path being propelled with mechanisms from the feet. The right hand also shows additional weapons being produced.Additional arms being equipped in battle.\nInfluences[]\nIn Buddhism, the Asura realm is the plane of semi-divine warring demons which people are reincarnated in due to actions based on jealousy, struggle, combat or rationalisation in a previous life, and though powerful, live in constant violence and conflict to which there is no resolution nor peace. Following a common depiction of Asura, this ability allows the user to possess six arms and three faces, each of which display a different emotion. Like Deva, Asura are also a race of supernatural beings. They are also featured in Hinduism as divine beings, and are known to live a life pursuing power, while indulgent and representative of materialistic and carnal pleasures. Both depictions play in the abilities of the Asura Path.\nIt also draws inspiration from Hinduism, where Asuras in mythology purportedly had the ability (called Astra) to use magical equivalents to modern day biological missiles.\n\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 Fourth Databook, page 257\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 551, page 6"}

Because Amenominaka works on everybody in the vicinity of Kaguya, she cannot use it to escape from attackers or to transport only certain individuals to other dimensions; for both purposes, she instead relies on Yomotsu Hirasaka.[5] Kaguya does seem to have some control over where she and the others will appear within a dimension, giving her a strategic option: when first depicted, she shifts high into the air of her lava dimension, leaving her opponents to fall into the molten sea below;[2] when she is being attacked by Naruto Uzumaki and Sasuke Uchiha, she shifts to a part of her ice dimension that places Naruto and Sasuke within a glacier, trapping them and thus stopping their attack.[5]\nWhen Kakashi Hatake first experiences Amenominaka, he believes it is the result of a genjutsu because of how suddenly it happens and how stark the change is from where he was (Earth). It is only from noticing that the new world is too vast in size and intricate in detail that he realises it cannot be a mere illusion.[2] He nevertheless revisits the genjutsu comparison later, noting that - from his perspective - Kaguya seems to be instantly rewriting reality with each use of Amenominaka.[5]"}

Using Inoichi's telepathic abilities, Shikaku was able to relay the formation to every member of the alliance at once.\nThe first step would executed by the Kumo-nin, who would use Lightning Release: Lightning Illusion Flash of Lightning Pillar to temporarily blind the opponents and Storm Release: Laser Circus to create a cloud of dust. Next, Suna-nin would use their Wind Release: Air Current Wild Dance to manipulate the dust to further obscure the Uchiha's vision, while Aburame clan members and Kiri-nin would use their Insect Jamming Technique and Hiding in Mist Technique to impair their sensory skills. \nThe second step, to restrain the Ten-Tails, would see the Iwa-nin create a large sink hole with their Earth Release: Great Moving Earth Core, with their lava users covering the beast with quicklime, mixing it with the Kiri-nin's water.

Kirara deemed Akkun as a defect for such traits. When the fabrications decided to take matters into their own hands, the Akuta produced even went against \u014cnoki's orders.\n\nDevelopment[]\n\u014cnoki created this technique in response to a missing-nin's attack claiming the lives of many young shinobi. When he first demonstrated it, they suddenly disobeyed him and attempted to attack the audience, which led Kurotsuchi to reject the technique's further development. Despite this, \u014cnoki continued to hone this technique in secrecy, eventually managing to create more obedient creatures.\nIwagakure housed an underground facility where more Akuta are being mass produced. It was later destroyed by Konohamaru Sarutobi.\n\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 Boruto episode 88\n\n\u2191 Boruto episode 82\n\n\u2191 Boruto episode 89"}

More often than employing his hands, B would wield his blades in and between various parts of his body.

As strange as it seems, Killer B is extremely skilled with these blades and this fighting style which he began adopting since a young age.[3] The most dangerous aspect of this style is the unpredictability of his movements, easily catching his opponents by surprise. He can spin in a manner similar to a buzz-saw, or else employing a series of unrelenting attacks switching the locations as well as the blades with which he attacks, leaving no openings for even a skilled Sharingan user like Sasuke Uchiha,[4] and a highly trained swordsman like Suigetsu H\u014dzuki, who remarked that the method of attack was completely unpredictable.[5] Killer B was also able to throw these swords from their normally awkward positions, either to hit his opponents from range, or to impale his opponent at close range and cause damage that would normally be lethal.[6]\nThe swords can be charged with lightning chakra to greatly increase their cutting power through high-frequency vibrations.[7] Because of the streamline shape of these swords, they serve as fairly good projectiles as well.[8] In the anime Killer B was able to use the Eight-Tails' tentacle to extend his reach for a surprise attack.[9]"}
