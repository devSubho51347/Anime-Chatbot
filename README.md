2. App Overview
The app integrates multiple machine learning models to provide insights into Naruto episodes, such as a character network, theme classification, and jutsu classification. Additionally, it includes a chatbot powered by a custom fine-tuned LLAMA model to simulate interactions with Naruto characters.

3. Character Network
Description: The character network visualization shows the relationships between characters in each episode.

How it works:

The app generates a graph where nodes represent characters, and edges represent their relationships in the episode.
A few-shot learning model is used to classify relationships based on context and interactions within the episode.
Usage:

Select an episode from the dropdown.
View the character network visualization generated using the relationships between characters.
4. Theme Classifier
Description: This classifier identifies the underlying theme of an episode (e.g., action, comedy, emotional, etc.).

How it works:

A few-shot learning approach has been employed for theme classification based on episode summaries or scripts.
It uses a model trained on episode metadata and summaries.
Usage:

Select an episode from the dropdown.
The app will classify the episodeâ€™s theme and display the results.
5. Jutsu Classification
Description: This component classifies various jutsus (techniques) used in the episodes.

How it works:

A DistilBERT model has been fine-tuned to recognize different jutsus based on episode context.
The model classifies jutsus by analyzing episode dialogues or descriptions.
Usage:

Select an episode.
The app will analyze the episode and classify the jutsus shown in that episode.
6. Naruto Chatbot
Description: This chatbot allows users to interact with Naruto characters using a conversational interface.

How it works:

The LLAMA 1B model has been fine-tuned to generate character-specific responses based on the input.
The model generates responses mimicking the personalities and dialogue style of the characters.
Usage:

Type in a message to interact with a Naruto character.
The chatbot will respond in character.
7. Custom Scraper
Description: The custom scraper extracts the required data for episodes, characters, jutsus, etc.

How it works:

The scraper scrapes data from a predefined external source (e.g., an anime database website).
The data is processed and saved for use in the app, such as episode information and character interactions.
Usage:

Run the scraper to extract the latest data.
The scraped data is used in various components of the app, such as the character network and jutsu classification.
8. Running the App
To run the Streamlit app locally, simply use the following command:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run app.py
This will launch the app in your browser, where you can interact with all the functionalities.

9. Future Enhancements
Improved Character Network: Integrating more detailed relationship data and visualizations.
Extended Jutsu Classification: Adding more jutsu categories and improving accuracy.
Character Personality Tuning: Fine-tuning the chatbot to reflect deeper nuances of Naruto characters.
Conclusion
This Streamlit app brings together multiple AI-driven functionalities to analyze and interact with Naruto episodes. From character networks to an interactive chatbot, the app provides a comprehensive exploration of the Naruto universe.
